How to create Project
  1. npx create-react-app <project_name> (no need to update create-react-app)

  or

  2. npm install create-react-app -g (install create-react-app globally)
  create-react-app <project_name> (then create project)
  (project with npm is we've to keep updating create-react-app when its installed globally)


Folder structure
  there's only one file - /public/index.html - we only see this file means there's only one html
  and there's only one js file - src/index.js - this index.js access the root(div of id root) element in index.html
  and then render the src/App.js in this root element and with routing we change the component in App.js
  that's why its called single page application (SPA)


How index.html and index.js are linked when there's no script tag in index.html
  when we run npm start - it start the project - and a file gets run npm/react-scripts/start.js
  this start.js calls react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js 
  this webpack link the index.html and index.js file
